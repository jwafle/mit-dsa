## Interface Definition

Specification defining
- What data you can store
- What operations can be done to the data (what they mean)

Equivalent of the problem statement.

## Data Structure

Representation defining
- How data is stored
- Algorithms for how to support operations

Equivalent to algorithmic solutions to the problem.

## Interfaces

### Set

Store N values and be able to search for a single value (a.k.a key).

### Sequence

Store N values in a particular sequence defined by the user.

#### Static

Number of items in set does not change.

`n` items: $x_0, x_1, x_2, ... , x_(n-1)

## Data Structure Approaches

### Arrays

### Pointer-based/Linked Data Structures
